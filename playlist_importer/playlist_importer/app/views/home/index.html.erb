      <p>The project was developed using <code>Rails 5.1.3</code> and <code>Ruby 2.4.1</code></p>
      <blockquote>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        The file <code>mp3_data.csv</code> provided has some encoding errors and since I was not sure if
        the enconding formating was part of the challenge I had to convert the file to <code>UTF-8</code>
        so the import could be done.
        I tried to do this formating on the code, but looks like it's a Windows/Excel issue and there's no
        solution without loosing some data.
        So, in order to import <code>mp3_data.csv</code>, you have to convert it to <code>UTF-8</code> before.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Some considerations about the approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I chose to not have a relation <code>songs_playlists</code> because I think it's unecessary</li>
        <li>I chose to name the <code>mp3</code> model as <code>Song</code> just for a better legibility, I'm aware of irregular inflections on Rails</li>
        <li>I chose to import the css framework as CDN because the gem that supports it it's outdated</li>
        <li>
          Some <code>mp3</code> data is incosistent, like this entry: <code>291,Tu Mira,Lole y Manuel,Kill Bill,Vol. 2 (Original Soundtrack),5,2004,Soundtracks,</code>
          where the Album (<code>Kill Bill,Vol. 2 (Original Soundtrack)</code>) has a comma, so the data is pushed right since the CSV parsing takes every comma spaced
          prahse as a field, leaving this Song with wrong data.
          I could edit this entries, but since this is a data input problem, I believe the input should remain as the original.
        </li>
        <li>Some caching could be done on <code>/users</code>, <code>/playlists</code> and all the counts</li>
        <li>The internationalization is configured but just to show that I can do it, it's lacing all the terms and phrases used on the views</li>
        <li>The <code>FileImporterHelper</code> spec is missing</li>
      </ul>
